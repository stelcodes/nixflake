## Essential Nix Resources

https://search.nixos.org

https://noogle.dev

```
man configuration.nix
man home-configuration.nix
```

## Wayland

Use `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb audacious` to see controls for adjusting plugin windows (Wayland QT issues)

## Dconf

Values can be defined with Home Manager's `dconf.settings` option.

```
dconf dump /org/cinnamon/ | dconf2nix | nvim -R
pkgs.gnome.dconf-editor for GUI
```

## Messaging

My favorites:

```
XMPP: pkgs.gajim
Signal: pkgs.signal-desktop
```

## Obsidian

Might have to `rm -rf ~/.config/obsidian/GPUCache` after a major update.

## Phone tethering

For iphone hotspot tethering use `pkgs.libimobiledevice`.

## Gaming

### Wireless Controllers

The Xbox One controllers models 1708 and 1797 are some of best wireless controllers for linux. The package that provides their firmware is called xpadneo.

### Emulators

## Media

https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Kodi

My preferred setup:
```
Services -> Weather -> Gismeteo
Interface -> Skin -> Colors -> Concrete
Media -> Library -> Update library on startup
Media -> Music -> Show Song and Album Artists -> False
Media -> Music -> Split Albums into Discs -> False
Media -> Music -> Default provider for albums -> Local Only
Media -> Music -> Default provider for artists -> Local Only
Media -> Music -> Visualisations -> On
Player -> Music -> Visualisation -> Goom
```
This music sources don't purge missing tracks even when cleaned so you have to remove .kodi/userdata/Database/MyMusic.db all the time. Seems fixable? ðŸ¤”

## Compatibility

`pkgs.appimage-run`
