## Gaming

### Wireless Controllers

The Xbox One controllers models 1708 and 1797 are some of best wireless controllers for linux. The package that provides their firmware is called xpadneo.

## Media

My preferred setup:
```
Services -> Weather -> Gismeteo
Interface -> Skin -> Colors -> Concrete
Media -> Library -> Update library on startup
Media -> Music -> Show Song and Album Artists -> False
Media -> Music -> Split Albums into Discs -> False
Media -> Music -> Default provider for albums -> Local Only
Media -> Music -> Default provider for artists -> Local Only
Media -> Music -> Visualisations -> On
Player -> Music -> Visualisation -> Goom
```
This music sources don't purge missing tracks even when cleaned so you have to remove .kodi/userdata/Database/MyMusic.db all the time. Seems fixable? ðŸ¤”
