- Add fail2ban service to servers
  - Service exists in nixpkgs, but I have to put filter files in place manually?
  - Need to read about fail2ban

- Make dev-blog-cms into systemd service
  - Rename to dev-blog-cms?

- Make dev-blog-generator into systemd service
  - Rename to dev-blog-generator?

Using home-manager is annoying. It makes setting up a server much harder because I have to add the channel.
- Switch away from home-manager to nixpkgs as soon possible for these things:
  - zsh
    - doable
  - tmux
    - no plugin support
  - git
    - no global config support
  - neovim
    - no plugin support
